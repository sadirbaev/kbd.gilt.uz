This website is for quick access to the Karakalpak keyboard. Some Karakalpak characters do not exist in current exist keyboard layouts. There have already been developed [custom keyboard layouts](https://jiemurat.github.io/QQ-kbd/), however, some devices and some OS do not support them.  If there will be such kinds of problems and if it is needed to write immediately some official letters and posts just open the link https://kbd.gilt.uz. It supports both Cyrillic and Latin alphabets.
